# G4PromFinder

G4PromFinder is an algorithm for the promoter prediction in bacterial genomes. It is recommended for GC rich genomes. G4PromFinder predicts putative promoters based on AT-rich elements and G-quadruplex DNA motifs.


Input: Genome sequences file.

Input file must be in fasta format.

Output: a text file containing promoter coordinates and a file containing informations about them.
